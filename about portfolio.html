<h3 id="headline"> About Karen Khalifah: </h3>
<p><blockquote id="blockquote">
<strong>I am most passionate about</strong> the experiences we create as humans through multiple forms 
of interaction. Those moments that stay with you. I want to create those moments. I 
love the creative process, especially brainstorming and collaborating. I am an artist 
first and foremost so I approach any design problem through the eyes of a fine artist. 
I like to have a hands on approach using all five senses to gather information about 
potential clients and understanding their brand.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong> I feel most proud when </strong>a client is blown away by a project I have had the privilege to
 work on. The impact of what you do directly affecting the business, and the consumer.
</p> 
<p> <strong>My dream job is</strong> a place where creativity rules and brilliant ideas are being born 
constantly. An environment filled with people working smarter and not harder. A place 
where the sky is the limit and employees are constantly challenged to succeed, thrive, 
and excel. </p>
